     This is the beta version. Really more like alpha. It was meant to be small and simple, but not as barren
     and boring as it is right now. Sorry about that. I hope to flesh this out a bit more before the final
     release, but we'll see.\b

     Please feel free to send me any and all ideas and suggestions, in addition to bug reports. I am also happy
     to provide the TADS 3 source code on request. Mail me at rwshuffle@gmail.com.\b
